Modern Fortran Programming on Gadi
=================================================

This document is a short introduction of modern Fortran for scientific computing.
We particularly focus on compiling parallel code and running Fortran95 code on Gadi.
We will write small programs in Fortran95, learn array-focused features, and compile with Gadi-supported compilers.
However, this is not a programming language course - we don't cover programming concepts in depth.
