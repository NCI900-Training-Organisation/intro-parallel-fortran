Modern Fortran Programming on Gadi
=================================================

This document is a short introduction of modern Fortran for scientific computing.
We focus on compiling and running parallel modern Fortran programs on Gadi. We will look into the basic language syntax, learn array-focused features, and compile with Gadi-supported compilers. However, this is not a programming language course - we don’t cover programming concepts in depth.
